Program is used to execute a search inside an existing local films database 'films.csv'.

There are 2 initial options for code execution:
1. Search by title: -t/--title [title name] (note: [title name] after -t/--title is required);
2. Search by genre: -g/--genre (note: no additional arguments required).

Note: if during search by title, there are titles with the exact same name(s), an additional release year information will be added for clarity.

Code examples:
1. Search by title: python main.py -t Drishyam
2. Search by genre: python main.py -g

Enjoy the code and have a nice one! Thank you for the lectures, Bohdan!
